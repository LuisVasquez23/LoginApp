# Google Login System with Clean Architecture

This repository contains a login system that utilizes Google credentials, implemented using the Clean Architecture pattern.

## Overview

The Clean Architecture approach was employed to design the system with separation of concerns in mind, ensuring that the business logic remains independent of external frameworks and libraries. This modular design facilitates testing and maintainability, as each layer of the architecture is isolated and can be easily replaced or updated without affecting the rest of the system.
